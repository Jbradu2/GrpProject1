# User Story

 When opening up the food recipe application you will be persented with a search bar. When the user puts in an input they are presented with several recipe options. To make the application look appealing we added a CSS framwork called Bulma. Creating functionality and naviagation for the user by applying JavaScript, inputing a recipe API to generate responses according to the user input. For the future of this appliacation there will be an option for meal prepping where the user will be presented with scheduling thier meals and populating a grocery list for the specific meal or meals. The user will be able to save recipes for future use. The application will also implement an allergen content so the user can input any food allergies for the website to prompt recipes with specific guidelines.
